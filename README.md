# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock The Draft - A Satyrical Game

## Development Environment (Initial Setup)
- Git SCM
- Visual Studio Code
- nodejs 10.13.0 
- Vue CLI 3.0.5

## Why! Stop asking questions. Not the time or place!

## No Seriously, why.  
I want to write a video game of some form. I love drafting games, and I suck at them. I love most games and I suck at them. I figure I should combine my want to make a game, and my ability to suck at things together. This is the result.

BTW, My moto is perfect is the enemy of good, good is the enemy of getting something done. This is what getting something done looks like. Ugly right!  Now stop being critical! You did not make this steaming pile.  Go make your own pile and I will comment on it. 

## Features/Brainstorming
- Five go in, three come out, one is chosen.
- That happens a few time, then send that list into battle.
- Custom commentary
- Achievements
- Well, Passive Agreesive Acheivements. 
  - For example "Try Hard" is what you get when you win your first game.
  - "Try Hard" the consolation is what you get of you have not won "Try Hard" and you witness someone else get "Try Hard".  (The flavor text makes it the consolation.)
  - Celbrity (minor, very minor) flavor text and comentary during playback of results.
